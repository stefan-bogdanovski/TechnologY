                <p class="wrap text-dark mFont">Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.
                     Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer.
                     <br/><br/>The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary”.
                       Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling”.
                        Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features,
                         though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.<br/><br/>
                    These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information.
                     For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked
                      to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.</p>

            C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.
              By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language.<br/><br/><br/>
              Such applications include operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.
              C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix.
                  Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.<br/><br/>

      <p class="card-text wrap mFont">Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
            Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aims to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
              Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.<br/><br/><br/>
              Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
              Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and
              a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles.
                Python 3.0, released 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible,
                and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.<br/><br/>

                            C&plus;&plus; is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language,
                             or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C&plus;&plus; has object-oriented, generic,
                              and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
                               It is almost always implemented as a compiled language and many vendors provide C&plus;&plus; compilers,
                             including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.<br/><br/>

                            Although JavaScript is a scripting language, we have to mention it because JS is the most used language in 2018. Javascript is high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
                             JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                             Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                             JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it
                             and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.<br/><br/><br/>

                Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented
                 (although not a pure OO language, as it contains primitive types), and designed to have as few implementation dependencies
                  as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code
                   can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled
                    to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
                 The syntax of Java is similar to C and C&plus;&plus;, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.<br/><br/>

                              <p class="pt-3 wrap">Java is used to develop enterprise-level applications
                                 for video games and mobile apps, as well as to create web-based applications with JSP
                                  (Java Server Pages). When used online, Java allows applets to be downloaded and used through a browser,
                                 which can then perform a function not normally available.<br/><br/>

                                    <li class="font-weight-bold">Java facts</li><br/>
                                    Currently, about 3 billion mobile phones are working in Java, as well as 125 million TV sets and each Blu-Ray player. This language is continually ranked first in the rankings of software developers as the best choice of programming languages.<br/><br/>
                                    The original name for Java was Oak. It was eventually changed to Java by Sun's marketing department when Sun lawyers found that there was already a computer company registered as Oak. But a legend has it that Gosling and his gang
                                     of programmers went out to the local cafe to discuss names and ended up naming it Java. There seems to be some truth in this as the "0xCafeBabe" magic number in the class files was named after the Cafe where the Java team used to go for coffee.<br/><br/>
                                    James Gosling was working at Sun Labs, around 1992. Gosling and his team was building a set-top box and started by "cleaning up" C&plus;&plus; and wound up with a new language and runtime. Thus, Java or Oak came into being.<br/>

                  C&num; (pronounced C sharp) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming
                   language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative,
                    functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming
                     disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018).
                   C&num; is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.<br/><br/>

                                      The name of the C Sharp language is stimulated by the musical notation.
                                       Here sharp, represent that the that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch.<br/><br/>

        <p class=" wrap mFont">If you are new to programming and you want to either become professional or you just want to write programs for fun, you should start with easy ones and there are definately some languages that are less complex than the others. My personal recommendation is C.
           After you learn C pick any object-oriented language you are interested
            in (c&num; /c&plus;&plus; for games, python for machine learning etc.), and you will not have hard time learning it.</p>
